First project based on "React - The Complete Guide" course on Udemy. Simple Burger builder application and includes integration with Firebase. Due to utilising React, it is a very fast and lightweight web page that allows the user to customise their order with a user friendly interface while also displaying a live look at the burger that the user is making. It also uses React Router with another page which has a Checkout layout and allows the user to insert their personal details using a form.
